> ## The Purpose

The purpose of the project is to integrate a technological system based on deep learning (DL) principles that will allow the classification of olive varieties based on a large amount of images.
The system will be based on deep learning that will analyze close-up photos of olive pits and will know, given a picture of an olive pit, to classify the pit to the species to which it belongs.
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

> ## Realization

The system consists of a DL system based on supervised learning (supervised learning), which receives a database of images of olive pits of various types where each image first comes with a classification label and thus the system performs training and then verification is carried out and the last step is the test itself, in which the system receives an image of a kernel olive and she needs to classify based on the knowledge she has gained to which variety the olive belongs.
